## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

During the Polkadot academy, founders track at Berkeley University, we developed our ideas and met key players in the Polkadot ecosystem.  Now, the second Founder's track from the Polkadot Academy will happen in Hong kong and we would like to:
- Meet the new founders entering the ecosystem.
- Connect with invetors, new proyects and engineers graduating in Hong Kong.
- Be part. Participate, help and contribute. 

### Project Details

During the first week of the Polkadot Academy, students are learning and meeting each other. We are interested in joining the second half of the program when ideas are well formed, engineers are graduating. Particularly, we would like to be part of the events being organized during the last two weeks which will bring investors, connections and allow us to stay on track with our proyects and the community. 

During those two weeks we will participate and be available to help, accomodating to the academy's needs.

### Ecosystem Fit

We are interested in keeping alive the founder's alumni and keeping it connected through lifespan. We believe the best profit of the academy is to stay connected and grow together. By being part of the final events at the new Polkadot academy, we will continue networking, growing our ideas, collaborating and growing together as a community.
